# Dynamic_Linked_List

## Introduction
Simple dynamic linked list data structure written in C++. 

Includes a small program that lets the user control the number of nodes in the list. There are several different process that can be performed (adding a new node, removing the max node, removing the min node, and printing the list) by commmenting/uncommenting the commands. Also, has a timer system that records and prints the execution time of the process. 

## How To Run
This repo contains just the source files for the linked list class and the driving program. The files can be added to a C++ project in an IDE like Visual Studio in order to be compiled and executed. They can also be compiled via command line.
